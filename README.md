# FallOutBoy Band Website
In this project the external user's goal will be the sites users are fans and potential fans
who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members and even possibily
book them for tours/shows easily. The site owners goals will be to publise themselves and sell more 
tickets to their tour while letting users know what they are all about. The audience for this
website will be all people who listen to music.
# Design Process
This website will be for a rock/punk band called FallOutBoy from their point of view,
they will want to let users know more about themselves and encourage them to book tickets
to their tour. My project will be the best way to do this as it will include all of the above,
a page to introduce themselves briefly, images and an video to show users how they are, an tour/gigs
page which shows the lastest upcoming tour with more information on it and a way to book it and finally a
contact page to allow users to contact them with any questions/problems.
